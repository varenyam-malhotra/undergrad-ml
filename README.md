# Undergrad Machine Learning Projects

## Iris Flower Classifier (Machine Learning)
Used machine learning-including k-means clustering (unsupervised learning) and classification using logistic regression and random forest 
(supervised learning) on the classic Iris dataset from scikit-learn. I classified iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) 
based on on speal and petal length and width. My code for this program include dataset visualization with pairplots and cluster plots as well as 
grouping unlabeled flowers ans evaluating model accuracy and feature importance. 

## Predicting Heart Failure and Mortality Rates using Logistic Regression and Machine Learning
Used machine learning-logistic regression-to predict heart failure and specifically mortality rate using the death_event feature and clinical data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Began with data exploration and cleaning and visualizing data using pairplots and feature-correlation heatmaps, for correlation coefficient graphs. I standardized data and used the stratify option via the scikit-learn to create a train-test split to build and train the machine learning model. I evaluated the model to have a logistic regression test accuracy score of 0.727 and then refined hyperparameters, retrained the model, and then finally created a logistic regression coefficients graph to determine the effect of each feature on the probability of a heart failure/mortality death_event.
